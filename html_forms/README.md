## Introduction

Form validation is an essential part of web development, ensuring that users provide valid and complete data when submitting forms on a website. In this project, we explore how to perform basic form validation using HTML.

## Features

This project includes several HTML form validation techniques:

1. **Required Fields**: Marking fields as required ensures that users cannot submit a form without completing these fields.

2. **Email Validation**: Using the `type="email"` attribute for an input field automatically validates whether the input is a valid email address.

3. **Password Strength**: You can enforce password strength requirements, such as a minimum length, the inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, and numbers.

4. **Pattern Matching**: The `pattern` attribute allows you to specify a regular expression pattern that the input must match. For example, you can use this to validate phone numbers or custom formats.

## Requirements

To use HTML form validation, you need the following:

- A modern web browser that supports HTML5 features.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the HTML files in your preferred web browser.

3. Explore the HTML code to see how form validation is implemented using various attributes and elements.

4. Experiment with the forms to see how validation works in practice.
